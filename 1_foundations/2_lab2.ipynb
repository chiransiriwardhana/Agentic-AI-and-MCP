Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

       "- Freedom with responsibility: Individuals have core freedoms, but freedoms come with duties to others and to future generations.\n",
       "- Dignity and equality: Every person deserves basic safety, opportunity, and protection from discrimination.\n",
       "- Solidarity and inclusion: Society should extend support to those in need and actively remove barriers to participation.\n",
       "- Rule of law and accountability: Laws apply equally; power is checked by independent institutions and transparent processes.\n",
       "- Sustainability and resilience: Decisions respect long-term social, environmental, and economic impacts.\n",
       "- Participatory legitimacy: Citizens have meaningful opportunities to influence decisions that affect them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Foundational rights and duties\n",
       "- Rights: Personal autonomy, privacy, freedom of expression within non-harmful limits, association, access to essential services (healthcare, education, housing), and equal protection under the law.\n",
       "- Duties: Obey laws, contribute to public goods, respect others’ rights, participate in civic life, and act with integrity toward the community and the environment.\n",

       "\n",
       "Institutional design\n",
       "- Constitutional architecture:\n",
       "  - A written constitution or charter that guarantees fundamental rights and sets out restraints on governmental power.\n",
       "  - A clear rights-enabled framework (e.g., a bill of rights with both negative and positive rights) and a proportionality test for any rights limitations.\n",
       "- Separation of powers with robust checks and balances:\n",
       "  - Legislature, independent judiciary, executive with accountable oversight, and transparent administrative agencies.\n",
       "  - Independent anti-corruption and ethics commissions, with strong whistleblower protections.\n",
       "- Independent information and deliberation:\n",
       "  - Free press and protected civic space.\n",
       "  - Public deliberation bodies (citizen assemblies, juries, deliberative polls) for major decisions.\n",
       "- Justice and accountability:\n",
       "  - Accessible, timely courts; restorative justice options where appropriate.\n",
       "  - Mechanisms for redress when rights are violated, including remedies and compensation.\n",
       "- Data, privacy, and technology governance:\n",
       "  - Clear rules on surveillance, data ownership, consent, and accountability for algorithmic decisions.\n",
       "  - Privacy safeguards as default; opt-out and transparency as standard practices.\n",

       "- Universal/near-universal services:\n",
       "  - Healthcare, education, housing supports, childcare, and basic income or guaranteed income floor to reduce insecurity.\n",
       "  - Environmental protections and climate resilience as public goods, funded by public resources and private incentives that align with sustainability.\n",
       "- Labor and mobility rights:\n",
       "  - Strong labor rights, fair wages, safe working conditions, and retraining programs for workers affected by technological change.\n",
       "  - Labor mobility within the country with portable benefits to reduce geographic inequality.\n",
       "- Housing and land use:\n",

       "Participatory and governance processes\n",
       "- Deliberative democracy and citizen participation:\n",
       "  - Regular citizen assemblies on major issues (e.g., climate, digital rights, education reform).\n",
       "  - Participatory budgeting at local levels; transparency about how decisions are funded and implemented.\n",
       "- Transparent policymaking:\n",
       "  - Clear impact assessments (economic, social, privacy, environmental) before laws are enacted.\n",
       "  - Sunset clauses and mandatory reviews for intrusive or rights-limiting measures.\n",
       "- Deliberation and conflict resolution:\n",
       "  - Systems to surface and address minority concerns, with strong anti-discrimination safeguards.\n",
       "  - Structured negotiation, mediation, and restorative justice options to resolve disputes without escalating coercion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Handling conflicts between personal liberties and societal needs\n",
       "- Foundational approach:\n",

       "  - Time-bound measures with built-in sunset clauses and independent sunset reviews.\n",
       "- Processes to resolve tensions:\n",
       "  - Rights impact assessments (RIA) for proposed policies to evaluate trade-offs for different groups.\n",
       "  - Legally enshrined overrides only for clear, evidence-based reasons (public safety, health, environmental protection) with judicial review.\n",
       "  - Differential but non-discriminatory accommodations where feasible (e.g., exemptions or alternatives for vulnerable groups).\n",
       "- Safeguards for civil liberties during crises:\n",
       "  - Emergency powers that are transparent, subject to oversight, with strict duration limits, and ongoing parliamentary scrutiny.\n",
       "  - Oversight by independent bodies and active communication with the public to maintain trust.\n",
       "- Respectful public discourse:\n",
       "  - Strong protections against discrimination and hate speech while preserving robust debate and dissent.\n",
       "  - Civic education to improve understanding of trade-offs and the rationale behind measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementation roadmap (phased)\n",
       "- Phase 1 (short term): Enshrine core rights and establish independent institutions; implement universal basic services pilots; begin participatory budgeting at local levels.\n",
       "- Phase 2 (medium term): Scale up social protections, pass comprehensive data/privacy laws, strengthen environmental standards, and embed deliberative mechanisms in key policy areas.\n",
       "- Phase 3 (long term): Institutionalize regular citizen assemblies for constitutional or major reforms; deepen education on civic rights and responsibilities; continually refine proportionality and sunset approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "Metrics and accountability\n",
       "- Well-being and capabilities: Measure actual freedoms people can exercise, not just formal rights.\n",
       "- Inequality and social protection: Track access to essential services, poverty rates, and opportunity gaps.\n",
       "- Democratic health: Participation rates, trust in institutions, disparities in civic engagement.\n",
       "- Sustainability: Environmental indicators, resource use, and resilience to shocks.\n",
       "- Rights protection: Incidence of rights violations, ease of redress, and independence of oversight bodies.\n",
       "\n",
       "A few quick alternative flavors you could consider\n",
       "- Liberal-democratic with strong social provision: Emphasizes a robust safety net and active government in ensuring equal opportunity, with strong civil liberties.\n",
       "- Participatory or deliberative democracy focus: Uses citizen assemblies and direct participatory budgeting as core governance tools.\n",
       "- Capabilities-based approach: Centers on expanding real freedoms people have to do and be meaningful in life, drawing on Sen/Nussbaum frameworks.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you tell me your context (region, culture, values, current institutions, and what you see as the biggest trade-offs), I can tailor this framework into a more concrete design with specific constitutional provisions, policy proposals, and governance processes."

       "Resolving a conflict between two parties with valid yet opposing perspectives on a historical event involves active listening, empathy, and careful facilitation. Here's a step-by-step approach to help ensure both sides feel heard and understood:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Establish a neutral and non-biased facilitator: Choose someone who is not emotionally invested in either perspective and can remain impartial throughout the process.\n",
       "2. Define the parameters of the conversation: Set clear guidelines for the discussion, such as the specific historical event in focus, the expectations for respectful dialogue, and the desired outcome (e.g., understanding, mutual respect).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Encourage open communication:\n",
       "   * Invite both parties to share their perspectives in an open and relaxed setting.\n",
       "   - Provide equal time for each party to express themselves without interruption or judgment.\n",
       "   * Listen attentively to each side's concerns and ask clarifying questions when necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Use active listening skills:\n",
       "   - Maintain eye contact with the speaker and nod to show understanding.\n",
       "   - Reflect back key points to ensure comprehension (e.g., \"Just to make sure I understand, you think...\").\n",
       "   - Avoid interrupting and let each side complete their thoughts before responding.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Foster empathy through storytelling: Encourage both parties to share personal anecdotes or stories related to the historical event. This can help create a deeper emotional connection and promote understanding.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Explore underlying assumptions and values: Help each party recognize the emotional triggers driving their perspectives. Encourage them to acknowledge any biases and explore alternative viewpoints with an open mind.\n",
       "7. Identify commonalities:\n",
       "   - Look for areas of agreement between the two perspectives.\n",
       "   - Emphasize shared goals or values that unite both parties.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Use neutral language: Refrain from using loaded language, idioms, or jargon that may exacerbate the conflict. Stick to clear and concise descriptions of events and avoid emotional appeals.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. Develop a \"bridge\" between competing narratives:\n",
       "   - Identify key moments in the historical event where different perspectives emerge.\n",
       "   - Work together to develop a more nuanced understanding of these critical points by considering multiple sources, texts, and expert opinions.\n",
